# Examples

This folder contains self-contained examples that demonstrate how to use **matGoFEM** in different workflows.

Each subfolder corresponds to one example and typically contains:

- A **MATLAB Live Script** (`*.mlx`)  
  - Interactive version: combines narrative text, code, and figures.
  - Recommended if you are working inside MATLAB.
- A **Jupyter notebook** (`*.ipynb`)  
  - Exported from the Live Script.
  - Viewable directly on GitHub and runnable in any standard Jupyter environment.

## How to use these examples

1. **From MATLAB**
   - Open the corresponding `*.mlx` file in the Live Editor.
   - Run the script section by section to explore the workflow.

2. **From Jupyter / GitHub**
   - Open the `*.ipynb` file directly on GitHub to inspect the code and outputs.
   - Optionally download it and run it in your own Jupyter environment.

## Example folders

- `LiveScript01`: **Resistivity cross-sections in 2-D and 3-D view**  
  Demonstrates how to import a VTU model and produce 2-D and 3-D resistivity cross-section plots.

- `LiveScript02`: **Create isosurfaces from VTU GoFEM models** *(Coming soon...)*  

> **Note:** The exact content and names of the example folders may evolve as matGoFEM grows.
